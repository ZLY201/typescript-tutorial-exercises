### **Intro**

All 2 users liked the idea of the community. We should go forward and introduce some order. We are in Germany after all.

Let's add a couple of admins.

Initially, we only had users in the in-memory database. After introducing Admins, we need to fix the types so that everything works well together.

### **Exercise**

Type "Person" is missing, please define it and use it in persons array and logPerson function in order to fix all the TS errors.
