### **Intro**

Since we already have some of the additional information about our users, it's a good idea to output it in a nice way.

### **Exercise**

Fix type errors in logPerson function.

`logPerson` function should accept both User and `Admin` and should output relevant information according to the input: occupation for `User` and role for `Admin`.
