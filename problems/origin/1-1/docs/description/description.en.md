### **Intro**

We are starting a small community of users. For performance reasons, we have decided to store all users right in the code.

This way we can provide our developers with more user-interaction opportunities.

With user-related data, at least.

All the GDPR-related issues will be solved some other day.

This would be the basis for our future experiments during these exercises.

### **Exercise**

Given the data, define the interface "User" and use it accordingly.
